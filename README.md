# CivitasGrid-TLP
CivitasGrid-TLP (TransLuxPop) is a fine-resolution urban grid dataset combining transportation structure, VIIRS nighttime lights, and WorldPop-derived population dynamics. Each sample is a geospatial cell with aligned covariates and contextual labels, enabling within- and cross-country generalisation studies.
